**Food Ordering Desktop App (Tkinter-Based GUI Application)**


**Problem Statement**

In many small food outlets and cafeterias, order-taking is still done manually, leading to slower service, increased human error, and difficulty in managing multiple orders efficiently. There is a need for a simple, intuitive, and low-cost digital ordering interface that allows users to select items, review their cart, and place orders without requiring advanced systems or internet connectivity.

This project aims to solve that problem by developing a lightweight, user-friendly desktop food ordering application using Python’s Tkinter library. The application provides a graphical interface through which a user can browse food items, add them to a cart, view prices, calculate totals, and place an order quickly and easily.



**Scope of the Project**

The scope of this project includes:

A functional GUI-based application that allows users to interact with a digital food menu.

Displaying menu items with associated prices.

Allowing users to add items to the cart with quantity tracking.

Auto-calculation of total bill based on items added.

Showing order confirmation using dialog prompts.

Clearing the cart after successful order placement.



**Target Users**

This application is intended for:

Students learning GUI development, event-driven programming, or beginner-level Python projects.

Small food stalls, kiosks, or cafes needing a simple offline ordering system.

Individuals looking to build a foundational Tkinter project for academic submission.

Users who need a minimal ordering interface without complex infrastructure.
